The app is designed to make it easier for players to calculate their move speed and choose which equipment they would like to take with them on their expedition.

The main functionality the client wanted for the app was:
<ol>
<li> Mobile view </li>
<li> To see all the equipment items and their weight in a table </li>
<li> To be able to select and deselect different items </li> 
<li> Totals to be calculated at each section when items are selected </li> 
<li> Conditional selection of certain items (tents and sleeping bags) </li>
<li> Move speed to be calculated and displayed </li>
</ol>
